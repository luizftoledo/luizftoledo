### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I used to do investigative journalism by talking to lots of people and reading hundreds of documents. I still do it, but now I have learned some code to find more stories and collaborate with data-driven projects. I'm here to share and learn more about coding for journalism and public accountability.

Stories I've written helped to [save millions in public funds](https://educacao.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,denuncia-do-estado-faz-prefeitura-abrir-nova-licitacao-e-economizar-r-15-2-mi,1608767) and investigate illegal practices from individuals, companies and governments.

 I also coordinate or contribute to multiple projects that improve government transparency in my home country, Brazil, as a means to enhance democratic participation.

I hold a Masters Degree in Public Administration at FGV-EAESP (Sao Paulo/Brazil) and pursue a [Master of Science in Data Journalism at Columbia University (New York/USA](https://journalism.columbia.edu/ms-data-journalism)
