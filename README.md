### Hi there 👋

I used to do investigative journalism by talking to many people and reading hundreds of documents to impact society positively. I still do it, but now I have learned some code to find more stories and collaborate with data-driven projects. I'm here to share and learn more about coding for journalism and public accountability.

Stories I've written helped to save millions in public funds and investigate illegal practices from individuals, companies and governments.

 I also coordinate or contribute to multiple projects that improve government transparency in my home country, Brazil, as a means to enhance democratic participation.

I hold a Masters Degree in Public Administration at FGV-EAESP (Sao Paulo/Brazil) and pursue a [Master of Science in Data Journalism at Columbia University (New York/USA](https://journalism.columbia.edu/ms-data-journalism)
