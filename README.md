### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I used to do investigative journalism to impact society positively. I still do it, but now I added some codes to suffer a little bit less during the tasks.

Stories I've written helped to save millions in public funds and investigate illegal practices from individuals, companies and governments.

 I also coordinate or contribute to multiple projects that improve government transparency in my home country, Brazil, as a means to enhance democratic participation.

I hold a Masters Degree in Public Administration at FGV-EAESP (Sao Paulo/Brazil) and pursue a Master of Science in Data Journalism at Columbia University (New York/USA).
